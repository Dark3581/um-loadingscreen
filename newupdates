SCENES

Added a resource to help immerse scenes a bit more you can use these 'scenes' for many things like the following.

Display text of a menu such as McDonald menu if you are rping there
Display text of a menu for garage parts if you are working at a garage
Leave evidence on scene/describe a scene to responding cops such as '7 ak rounds left at scene next to person'

There is alot you can do really, of course like the chat everything is logged so same rules apply if you type anything bad.

Commands

/scene [text to go on scene] (Can also be used while creating a scene again to update its text)
/sceneremove (To remove nearby scene, if you have permission to do so)
/scenehide (To toggle seeing scenes)
